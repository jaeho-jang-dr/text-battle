## Testing Required
1. Re-initialize NPCs to apply new stats
2. Test battles against NPCs to verify they are easier
3. Verify battle explanations appear approximately 50% of the time
4. Check that explanations and tips display correctly in the UI
5. Ensure the battle system continues to function properly

## Next Steps
1. Run `npm run init-npcs` to re-initialize NPCs with new stats
2. Clear any existing NPC data if necessary
3. Test the new balance in actual gameplay
4. Monitor player feedback on difficulty and explanation helpfulness
